          History of the Brand
        </h1>
        <p>
          Tareghon is a distinctive shoe and slippers brand with a deeply
          personal and meaningful name. The inspiration for the name began with
          my mother, Oare. Her name means 'home is home', symbolizing the idea
          that no matter where you go, you always return home.
        </p>
        <p>
          This concept resonated deeply with me, as I wanted our slippers to
          represent the comfort and familiarity of home. Wearing Tareghon
          slippers means you are at home, feeling a sense of belonging and ease.
        </p>
        <p>
          Initially, I wanted to honor my mother's legacy by naming the brand
          'Oare'. However, I discovered that many brands already used this name,
          so I sought to create something unique by merging it with other names.
        </p>
        <p>
          My middle name, Eghonghon, provided the next piece of the puzzle. I
          decided to take 'ghon' from 'Eghonghon' and combine it with 'are' from
          'Oare', creating 'areghon'.
        </p>
        <p>
          Despite this effort, the name still didn't feel quite right. To add a
          personal touch, I included the letter 'T' from my first name,
          Perpetual, resulting in the final name, 'TAREGHON'.
        </p>
        <p>
          This name resonated with me and my sweet friend have known for ages
          and guess what I popularly call her cockroach, who helped brainstorm
          and refine the concept. Her input and support were invaluable, and the
          name 'Tareghon' received positive feedback for its uniqueness and
          meaningful story.
        </p>
        <p>
          Tareghon has been in business for five years, starting with
          Birkenstock materials and expanding into a wide variety of footwear.
          Our journey has been one of dedication, creativity, and resilience.
          The name represents a combination of my name and my mother's,
          symbolizing our unbreakable bond and shared values.
